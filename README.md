## About project
5 mini games that you can play in your terminal client. Use your brain to solve different kinds of math tasks. Each game consists of 3 rounds. Win all of 3 to win the game. Once you lose the round, you lose the game, so just start over ;)

## How to play
Use these commands in terminal to start one of 5 games:
**brain-even** – a game where you have to decide if the given number is even or not.
**brain-calc** – a game where you have to calculate the simple math expression.
**brain-gcd** - a game where you have to find the Great Common Divider of two given numbers. Yep, that's tough one.
**brain-prime** - a game where you have to check if the given number is Prime (divides on 1 and itself only).
**brain-prog** - a game where you see a progression of numbers but one is missing, so you have to guess it.

## Install
1. clone project
2. install dependencies (lodash, readline-sync)
3. in terminal (project directory) run: **make publish**
4. run: **npm link**
5. play! (see *"How to play"* above)
