## About project
5 mini games that you can play in your terminal client. Use your brain to solve different kinds of math tasks. You will really need to recall some school knowledge. Hope, you studied well ;)

## How to play
Use these commands in terminal in the project dir to start one of 5 Brain Games:
- **brain-even** –decide if the given number is even or not.
- **brain-calc** – calculate the simple math expression.
- **brain-gcd** - find the Great Common Divider of two given numbers. Yep, that's tough one.
- **brain-prime** - check if the given number is Prime (divides on 1 and itself only).
- **brain-prog** - guess the missing number of a given progression.

Each match of the chosen game consists of 3 rounds. If you lose a round, you lose the game. Just start over with any command from list above.

## Install
1. clone project
2. install dependencies: **npm install lodash**, **readline-sync**
3. in terminal (project directory) run: **make publish**
4. run: **npm link**
5. play! (see *"How to play"* section above)
